# PR Summary: Agentic AI Reference Architecture with AIR Governance

## What Was Created

This PR introduces a **flexible, high-level reference architecture** for agentic AI systems with embedded FINOS AIR (AI Readiness) governance controls, designed as a multi-document CALM specification.

## Addressing the Requirements

Based on the GitHub comment in [finos/ai-governance-framework#218](https://github.com/finos/ai-governance-framework/pull/218#issuecomment-3296745868):

### ‚úÖ Goal 1: Flexible & High-Level Architecture for Arbitrary Tech Stacks

**Achieved Through**:

- **Tech-Stack Agnostic Design**: Every component marked with `"tech-stack-flexibility"` to indicate customization points
- **Multiple Framework Support**: LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, custom implementations
- **LLM Provider Flexibility**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, self-hosted models
- **Deployment Options**: Cloud-native, hybrid, air-gapped, on-premise
- **Component Customization**: 18 nodes can be mapped to any implementation

**Example**:
```json
{
  "unique-id": "llm-service",
  "metadata": {
    "tech-stack-flexibility": "OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, self-hosted"
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Goal 2: Embedded AIGF Controls Throughout

**Achieved Through**:

- **9 Agentic-Specific Threats**: Including new threats like "Agent Autonomy and Control Loss" (AIR-SEC-009)
- **10 AIR Controls**: With 3 new agentic-specific controls:
  - `AIR-PREV-013`: Agent Autonomy Limits
  - `AIR-PREV-014`: Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints
  - `AIR-DET-007`: Agent Behavior Anomaly Detection
- **Multi-Level Embedding**: AIR metadata at metadata, node, relationship, control, and flow levels
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every node includes threat and control mappings

---

### ‚úÖ Goal 3: Multi-Document CALM Structure

**Achieved Through**:

#### Main Architecture Document
- **File**: `agentic-ai-reference-architecture.calm.json` (1,628 lines)
- **Purpose**: High-level reference architecture
- **Metadata Section**: Declares sub-component references

```json
{
  "modularity": {
    "sub-components": [
      {
        "name": "MCP Server Component",
        "reference": "./components/mcp-server.calm.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Sub-Component Structure
- **Directory**: `components/`
- **Existing Component**: MCP Server (symlink to existing spec)
- **Future Components**: Agent Communication Protocol, Knowledge Base
- **Node-Level References**: Nodes point to their detailed sub-component specs

```json
{
  "unique-id": "mcp-server",
  "metadata": {
    "sub-component-reference": "./components/mcp-server.calm.json",
    "note": "See detailed MCP component specification for full architecture"
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Goal 4: Support for Agent-to-Agent Communication

**Achieved Through**:

- **Direct Agent Communication**: Relationship `agent-to-agent-planning-to-execution`
- **SPIFFE/SPIRE Authentication**: For secure agent identity
- **Future Sub-Component**: `components/agent-communication.calm.json` referenced for detailed patterns
- **Coordination Service**: Node for managing multi-agent coordination

```json
{
  "unique-id": "agent-to-agent-planning-to-execution",
  "description": "Direct agent-to-agent communication",
  "metadata": {
    "sub-component-reference": "./components/agent-communication.calm.json",
    "authentication": "mTLS + SPIFFE"
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Goal 5: Extensibility for Future Updates

**Achieved Through**:

- **Modular Design**: Components can be versioned independently
- **Reference Architecture Pattern**: Easy to adapt and extend
- **Sub-Component Placeholders**: Future components clearly identified
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Multiple tech stacks documented

**Future Extensions**:
1. Enhanced MCP component for agent-to-agent via MCP
2. Agent Communication Protocol detailed spec
3. Knowledge Base Component detailed spec
4. LLM Service Component patterns
5. Advanced coordination patterns
